# AI-Engineer-Skill-Library
Welcome to the AI Engineer Skill Repo! This repository is a personal development project where I'm learning to create and organize reusable AI skills. The goal is to build a set of skills that can be used across my various chat workspaces as part of my AI roadmap.

Project Structure

Workspaces: The skills here are designed to support different chat-based workspaces, each focused on a unique aspect of AI engineering (like Social Media Outreach, Skill Engineering, and more).

Skills: Each skill is a modular unit, with a clear purpose and use case, intended to be easily integrated into those workspaces.

Vision: The overarching vision is to get comfortable with building a skill repository that can grow and evolve as I continue on my AI engineering journey. Over time, Iâ€™ll refine the structure and add more detailed documentation.

Feel free to explore, and thanks for checking it out!
